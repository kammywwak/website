description: Blue (-Haired Liberal) Period is a self-portrait exploring identity and belonging as a migrant in the West. After a decade on the U.S. West Coast, the artist was surprised to find herself labeled a blue-haired liberal. In this portrait, she tries on blue hair as a means of questioning the projections imposed upon her and examining the agency one has in reclaiming or resisting them.
